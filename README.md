<h4>User's Story</h4>
<p>
I want to know if my game will be affected by the weather and the layout of the course.
</p>
<p>
I can use google map and weather app to look up this data, but now I have a new golfing app
</p>

When I arrive at the golf course, I open my app
<ul>
<li>
Weather & forecast details at the location will showed up.
</li>
<li>
Then I click on a tab, the map of the course will be displayed.
</li>
<li>
Current wind speed and direction will also become available
</li>
</ul>
<div>
Then I proceed to start my game
</div>
<ul>
<li>
At the 1st hole, I clikc on a tab and a scorecard is displayed
</li>
<li>
If I incurred a penalty, I click on a button on my app and record the type of penalty. Score is stored on local storage
</li>
<li>
At the conclusion at a hole, I then click a button indicating moving on to the next hole.
</li>
<li>
Process continue until game completed at hole number 18.
</li>

Then my score is tally up and my performance at each hole and the game is displayed.
</li>
</ul>
